## Poem 

```plaintext
The stars above, they twinkle bright,
Guiding us through the darkest night.
In their light, we find our way,
A beacon of hope, come what may.

The moon, a friend in silver glow,
Watches over us, to and fro.
In its calm, we seek our peace,
As troubles and worries seem to cease.

Nature's symphony, a wondrous song,
With every note, we feel we belong.
In its embrace, we find our grace,
Amidst the chaos of life's race.

So let us cherish each fleeting hour,
Embrace the beauty, the strength, the power.
For in this world, so vast and wide,
Love and kindness will be our guide.
